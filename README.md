A compassionate and responsive web application designed to support mothers during the postpartum period with real, empathetic, and practical information — built with love, technology, and personal experience.

## Description

This project offers reliable resources for new mothers navigating the physical and emotional changes after childbirth. It includes:

- Educational content on postpartum recovery
- A dedicated section on breastfeeding with real-life insights
- A private journal with full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using `localStorage`
- A contact form with custom JavaScript validation (no HTML5 attributes used)
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Scroll-triggered animations, hover transitions, CSS keyframe animations, and subtle gradients
- A personal photo gallery featuring real moments of care

Built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks used, except **Font Awesome** for icons (as permitted by the assignment).
